Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN)

This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating realistic images.
Dataset Preprocessing

    Download the Dataset
        The dataset should be stored in a directory, with images organized properly.
        This implementation uses the CelebA dataset, which can be downloaded from here.

    Set Up the Dataset Directory
        Move the dataset to a specified directory (e.g., /kaggle/input/celeba-dataset).
        Ensure that the directory contains image files.

    Apply Transformations
        Resize images to 64Ã—64 pixels.
        Convert images to tensor format.
        Normalize pixel values to the range [-1, 1].

Training the Model

    Set Up Dependencies
        Install necessary libraries such as PyTorch, torchvision, and Matplotlib.

    Run the Training Script
        Set hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, epochs, etc.).
        Use the train() function to train the model.
        Save the generator model (G.pth) and discriminator model (D.pth) after training.

    Monitor Training
        Track the loss values of the generator and discriminator.
        Save sample images at regular intervals to visualize progress.

Testing the Model

    Load the Pretrained Generator
        Load the trained generator model using PyTorch.

    Generate Images
        Sample random noise vectors (latent space).
        Feed them into the generator to create synthetic images.

    Visualize the Results
        Display generated images using Matplotlib.

Expected Outputs

    The model should generate realistic-looking images after sufficient training.
    Initially, the outputs may appear noisy, but they improve as training progresses.
    Final images should resemble real human faces.
